It was fairly easy to spot the typo using diff command.
In one of the first lines I have spotted the difference:
use of space and then just followed + signs to find the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Easily track changes
Rollback to previous versions
Debugging

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
 a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, 
like Google Docs does?
+Full control
+Logical link
-Can be forgotten, too big or two small to be useful


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
 allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Being more code oriented, Git needs to track interrelated files togeather.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log --stat ;will show statistics of changes too
git diff id1 id2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because you would not need to remember all changes you have maid to return to previous state should it be neccessary.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

First order of things will be to try this on my Merlin firmware for KosselMini
