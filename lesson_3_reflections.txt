When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Sharing project and collaborating with other people.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

More control. Maybe you want to push only when some stage ic complete which took multiple commits.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - done in github and link to original repository is preserved
Clones - Just copy repo, no previous history (apart from commits)
Branches - in same repo, different features, etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Can compare you local branch to it. Good especially when collaborating or working from different machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Easier with git and gihub. Could send revised versions of files to all involved asking for comments, if everybody is ok
they update their versions. Very inefficint and slow. Especially if many people working on the project.

---------------------------------------------------------------

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Collaboration. People can work on their own brances without too much congestion in master branch.
